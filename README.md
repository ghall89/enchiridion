# Enchiridion

## About

A simple guide to D&D, built using NextJS, using data from the [5e-database repo](https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-database).

### ⚠️ Adventurers beware! ⚠️

This is a very bare-bones project that I built to familiarize myself with Typescript. Any misadventures resulting from the use of this app, including, but not limited to, goblin attacks, mindflayer infections, or necrotic contaminations, are the sole responsibility of the user.
